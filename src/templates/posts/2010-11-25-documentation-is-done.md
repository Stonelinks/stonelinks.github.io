Suzanne has told me to stop working on the current incarnation of the documentation as I had been writing it for an audience unacquainted with my work, not for her and my coworker. I have provided her with what she needs, but it would be a shame for all the writing I did not to see the light of day. Maybe it will be useful to someone. After all, it was written for an unacquainted audience, so you might learn something! [Here it is]({{ page.base_url }}misc/CfA_doc.pdf)
