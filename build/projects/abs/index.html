<p>The The Awesome Backup System (<span class="caps">ABS</span>) is a cross platform file backup solution. It consists of a server and three native clients for <span class="caps">OS</span> X, Windows and Linux. They all communicate with the server through a common <span class="caps">API</span>. It was written for a Software Design and Documentation class at <span class="caps">RPI</span> in the fall of 2011 by Lucas Doyle, Peter Fernandes, Kevin Todisco and Jeff Hui. Since it was written for a documentation class, the majority of the time making <span class="caps">ABS</span> was actually spent documenting&nbsp;things.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Native clients:</em></strong> One of our goals was that all clients are native to their platforms. We wanted to stay away from cross platform tools like java or Qt for the <span class="caps">GUI</span>. Using these tools would have cut down on development time, but we felt that customer’s expect a certain look and feel to their applications that are consistent with the platform they are running&nbsp;on.</li>
<li><strong><em><span class="caps">API</span>:</em></strong> A common <span class="caps">API</span> for our server was developed using django to allow different languages and platforms to use <span class="caps">ABS</span>, as well as enforce implementation consistency for all clients. The <span class="caps">API</span> includes features for uploading and downloading files, managing different computers, authentication, and more. Additionally, the development <span class="caps">API</span> makes it easy to add new clients without changing anything on the&nbsp;server.</li>
<li><strong><em>Minimal bandwidth usage:</em></strong> The <span class="caps">API</span> was also designed so that clients would only have to transfer the minimal amount of file contents to the server. During a backup cycle, the client downloads a list of hashes from the server that correspond to files that have already been backed up. The client starts generating hashes for all the files it is currently trying to back up, and if any of them match the old hashes downloaded from the server, then that particular file is already backed up and the upload is&nbsp;skipped.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-future-improvements">Possible Future Improvements</h2>
<p><strong><em>Security:</em></strong> <span class="caps">ABS</span> is lacking is in the security department. It being a prototype we wrote for a class, security wasn’t one of our goals. Still, we are using <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> (though we feel like that alone isn’t a very good security measure) and never store or transfer passwords in plaintext. In fact, because the clients (and <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> technically) are stateless entities, every <span class="caps">API</span> request needs to be authenticated for it to do anything. This means no cookies or any artifact of your authentication other than a hashed password remains on the&nbsp;client.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimize disk space:</em></strong> Similar to git and other version control systems, one of the ways we could cut down on disk storage space for files is storing incremental “diffs” for changes between backup&nbsp;cycles.</p>
