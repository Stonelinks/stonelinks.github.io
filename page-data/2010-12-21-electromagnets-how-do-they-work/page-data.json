My brother asked me for help making a small electromagnet to bring into Boy Scouts for electricity merit badge. I of course jumped at the opportunity, and asked what kind of power source they are going to be using to drive said magnet. He tells me they will be using a single D battery. Thinking this is kind of small, I spent a few hours making the biggest electromagnet I could from a few things around the house I could find.</p>\n<p>I ultimately settled on sawing an old golf club in half, stuffing a large bolt down the hollow inside, and then mounting the whole thing in a drill to facilitate easy winding of some low-gauge wire I found in our garage. To top it off, I powered the whole thing with an old computer power supply (5V at 25A I believe). The whole affair vaguely looks like some kind of torture device. The end result is a large electro magnet that can pick up very heavy weights and gets furiously hot and smells like burning plastic if left on for more than 5 minutes. Totally overkill for Boy Scouts, but totally awesome.</p>\n<p>Mission: Success.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Electromagnets, How do They Work?","date":"December 21, 2010","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-12-20-stonelinks-hosted-at-my-house/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stonelinks Hosted at my House"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-01-06-a-more-accurate-coordinate-system/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A More Accurate Coordinate System"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e8571361-39cb-5edf-aed5-bc12f5f5c8f0","previousPostId":"402cbfa6-f007-543e-8a12-8da3e31a955c","nextPostId":"56a02845-efda-5ad4-86b7-f267b4c92b06"}},
