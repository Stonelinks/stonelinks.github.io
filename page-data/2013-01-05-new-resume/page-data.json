The more people who see your resume, the better your chances of getting an interview or call back from a potential employer! This means the more formats and places that your resume is viewable in, the better. When I was looking for a job, I tried to follow this strategy but quickly tired making the same change on multiple versions of my resume in different formats.</p>\n<p>Like any programmer that has to do anything more than once, I wanted to automate this. So I endeavored create a better resume authoring solution. Specifically, I wanted these features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explicit separation of resume data from resume formatting</li>\n<li>Store resume data in an easy to manipulate format</li>\n<li>Write once, publish / deploy the resume everywhere</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I ended up engineering a solution that used a JSON file to store resume data, and a simple python program that would use different “writers” to spit out the resume in different formats. Here is a breakdown of the supported formats using a combination of the generator and some macros in a Makefile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>text</li>\n<li>html</li>\n<li>pdf (using <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/\">wkhtmltopdf</a>)</li>\n<li>markdown</li>\n<li>stonelinks-specific markdown (basically a special markdown template used specifically for the resume on this website)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyhow it is finished and it works great for my purposes. The code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/Stonelinks/resume\">here</a> on github. It should be easy for others to use it, just fork and modify the JSON with your resume data and have at it!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Resume","date":"January 05, 2013","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-04-29-lite-write/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I do Word Processing"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-10-31-2013-irex-binpicking/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2013 IREX Binpicking Survey"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"566e3eb4-ad21-5b36-9930-9b8ea210c173","previousPostId":"d4aeb8bf-b70a-567e-8a19-bbc08edbad76","nextPostId":"51090118-fe45-5bbe-9957-d0bda10a6c33"}},
