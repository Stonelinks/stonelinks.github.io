However, its a nice feeling to have some code I wrote incorporated into someone else’s project for a change.</p>\n<p>The program in question here is called <a href=\"https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD\">OpenTLD</a>. Its a program for tracking objects (not just faces) in unconstrained video streams with NO training data beforehand (TLD stands for <strong>T</strong>racking, <strong>L</strong>earning and <strong>D</strong>etection). Instead of using precomputed classifiers (like I previously have done with OpenCV), OpenTLD builds a model of what it is supposed to be detecting on the fly. To demonstrate, above is a slightly creepy demo of OpenTLD tracking my face.</p>\n<p>The version of OpenTLD here is actually the C++ implementation of OpenTLD. OpenTLD began life as a bunch of <a href=\"https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD\">Matlab programs</a> written as part of Zdenek Kalal’s PHD thesis. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GhNXHCQGsM\">Here</a> is a more advanced video by him talking / showing off OpenTLD (he calls it Predator).</p>\n<p>But so yeah! <a href=\"https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD/pull/11\">I actually contributed to this</a>! Even though the code I wrote is trivial (it had to do with the bounding box when you first start the program), it still makes me really excited. I plan on taking a closer look at the codebase sometime later and trying to learn how it works. Up until now all my contributions to open source have been programs I have written. It feels really cool to have a change I made rolled into this super advanced computer vision program!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Contribution to Open Source Software","date":"March 26, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-01-01-sudoku-solver/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sudoku Solver"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-04-21-new-drone/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Drone"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3de5f2f6-539d-542b-9fb8-e8fb82b553ea","previousPostId":"b9db2ff6-7477-5794-9313-9e3f47a0f41f","nextPostId":"6ca02128-f093-51ba-bed6-33fc697e31ff"}},
