Earlier today I found myself with a need to extract a whole bunch of icons, block diagrams and VI hierarchies a bunch of LabVIEW programs for some documentation I was writing. In my case, I was using LaTeX and wanted to include visuals from my LabVIEW stuff.</p>\n<p>Up until now I thought this would mean trying to do a million screenshots over VNC on my work computer, and then going back and cropping what I needed. This seemed horrible though and on further research I was thrilled to find out that LabVIEW can pretty much do this on its own. See the <a href=\"http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361B-01/lvconcepts/printing_vis/\">NI website on printing VI documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Basically what I did was import the VI hierarchy for my top level VI (the lab dashboard in my case), create a custom format for my documentation, check off what I want to appear, and then output it all as HTML. Since the directory where the HTML was generated is now chock full o’ images, I just took what ones I wanted and inserted them into my documentation and discarded the HTML. Just goes to show you how a user can find many different ways to use a one part of a program for what it might not have originally been intended. Probably a couple hours of tedious screenshotting saved! And I can re-run the process any time if things change.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"LabVIEW Custom Documentation Formats","date":"November 21, 2010","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-11-21-latex-is-fun/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Latex is Fun"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-11-24-documentation-is-done/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Harvard Documentation is Done"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"62223351-c706-55f7-9e71-526b22a48014","previousPostId":"03a6eb36-e879-5193-9596-dba1993dc8af","nextPostId":"7e85203e-197e-5d55-a6b0-524d6acc78cc"}},
