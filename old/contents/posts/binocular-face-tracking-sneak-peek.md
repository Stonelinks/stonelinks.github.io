The code needs a little more polish before I'm happy releasing it, but here is a demo video of the latest incarnation of the 'bot doing some binocular face detection and tracking. For added fun (and in honor of [Portal 2](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/) which comes out this week), I have it playing context-aware sound clips from the turrets in the game when it spots people or loses track of them.
