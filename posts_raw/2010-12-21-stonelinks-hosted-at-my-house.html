<p>Looks like the kinks of my new <a href="dr-serverlove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-raid.html">two-server</a> setup are not ironed out. I just got home from RPI and the old Dell is acting wacky. I thoroughly checked both machines before I left for home, and I thought everything was okay. However, upon arriving home, I checked the web server to find that it doesn&#39;t work -- not even a 404 page or a time out error, the browser just hangs.</p>
<p>To use anything other than HTTP on port 80, I need to be on RIP&#39;s VPN. I log into the VPN and start with the basics. The machine (which is not behind a router) responds to ping, however ssh shows the same symptoms as apache. I don&#39;t even get a connection refused or path not found or timeout error, the login literally just hangs (I left it running for like 30 min now).</p>
<p>After being thoroughly baffled by this, I ran NMAP from another machine on the same network:</p>
<pre>
[luke@void ~]$ nmap -A -T4 stonelinks.org
Starting Nmap 4.11 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) at 2010-12-27 03:39 EST
Interesting ports on doylel2.stu.rpi.edu (128.113.38.125):
Not shown: 1676 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
21/tcp  open  ftp?
22/tcp  open  ssh?
80/tcp  open  http?
111/tcp open  rpcbind?
</pre>

<p>I have VPN access and control over other computers on the same network, but obviously no physical access to the machine. I have no idea what is going on here, my assumption is that the kernel is hanging on something, but I guess I&#39;ll find out when I get back. Because of the way RPI manages IP addresses, the firewall at RPI, and the uncertainty of the other computer, I&#39;m hesitant to just tell my desktop to take the old MAC / IP for Stonelinks until I get back on campus in case I lose both machines. Luckily I had a backup of Stonelinks that I moved to my house. So until I get back on campus, I am hosting off my houses internet connection! Be warned in this time Stonelinks will be operating in a pretty crippled capacity.</p>
