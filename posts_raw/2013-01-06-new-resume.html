<p>Over the holidays I finally got around to implementing what I wish existed back when I was looking for a job: a quick, easy and flexible way to write and publish a resume in many formats. The more people who see your resume, the better your chances of getting an interview or call back from a potential employer. This means the more formats and places that your resume is viewable in, the better. I tried to follow this strategy, however quickly tired making the same change on multiple versions of my resume.</p>
<p>Like any programmer that has to do anything more than once, I wanted to automate this tedious editing. So I endeavoured create a better reseume authoring solution. Specifically, I wanted these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit seperation of resume data from resume formatting</li>
<li>Store data in an intuitive and easy to manipulate format</li>
<li>Write once, publish and deploy resume everywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to separate data from formatting, I decided the best thing would be to store the resume data in a JSON file and then use a python script to print out different views of the content. I called this program the &quot;generator&quot; since it essentially generated a resume instance from an input JSON file. The generator uses different &quot;writers&quot; to print it back out in different formats. Here is a breakdown of the different formats supported using a combination of the generator and some macros in a Makefile:</p>
<ul>
<li>text</li>
<li>html</li>
<li>pdf (using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/">wkhtmltopdf</a>)</li>
<li>markdown</li>
<li>stonelinks-specific markdown (which is what is used to generate the html for my resume on this website)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow it is finished and it works great for my purposes. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/Stonelinks/resume">here</a> on github. It should be easy for others to use it, just fork and modify the JSON with your resume data and use the generator to re-generate the resumes.</p>
