<p>Up until now, all my contributions to open source have been programs I have written, and as a general practice I like to make all my work open source if I can. However, its a nice feeling to have some code I wrote incorporated into someone else&#39;s project for a change.</p>
<p>The program in question here is called <a href="https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD">OpenTLD</a>. Its a program for tracking objects (not just faces) in unconstrained video streams with NO training data beforehand (TLD stands for Tracking, Learning and Detection). Instead of using precomputed classifiers (like I previously have done with OpenCV), OpenTLD builds a model of what it is supposed to be detecting on the fly. To demonstrate, above is a slightly creepy demo of OpenTLD tracking my face.</p>
<p>The version of OpenTLD here is actually the C++ implementation of OpenTLD. OpenTLD began life as a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD">Matlab programs</a> written as part of Zdenek Kalal&#39;s PHD thesis. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GhNXHCQGsM">Here</a> is a more advanced video by him talking / showing off OpenTLD (he calls it Predator).</p>
<p>But so yeah! <a href="https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD/pull/11">I actually contributed to this</a>! Even though the code I wrote is trivial (it had to do with the bounding box when you first start the program), it still makes me really excited. I plan on taking a closer look at the codebase sometime later and trying to learn how it works. Up until now all my contributions to open source have been programs I have written. It feels really cool to have a change I made rolled into this super advanced computer vision program!</p>
