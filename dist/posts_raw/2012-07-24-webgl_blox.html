<p>This is a quick and dirty attempt to a clone a really addicting android game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.entwicklerx.tapblox&amp;hl=en">Tap Blox</a>. Play by eliminating groups of three or more adjacent blocks of the same color. Currently there is no timing / scoring system.</p>
<p>I did this as an educational exercise, mostly to play around with WebGL and improve my skills at Javascript (which I know very little about). Plus programming is fun in general. The WebGL library I used used is Mr. Doob&#39;s excellent <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">Three.js</a>. Hope you enjoy! Best results with Google Chrome.</p>
