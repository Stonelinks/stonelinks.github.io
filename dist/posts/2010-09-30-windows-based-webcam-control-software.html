<p>I love nothing more in life than creating and tinkering with the stuff around me. Over the years, this love has taken many different forms. It started out somewhere in elementary school with Legos and taking my toys apart (much to the chigrin of my loving parents). Today it has evolved over the years into weekend projects such as the I&#39;m about to tell you about.</p>
<p>One weekend early in the semester, I found myself with some rare free time and so I chose to make my own internet-aware pan-tilt fixture for my webcam. To my room mates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm">delight</a>, I have placed the controls to this camera on this website.</p>
<p>Projects such as this are just the kind of thing that I love taking time to do. They span the full stack, and involve concepts that go from very low level micro controller programming to high level web programming, using all sorts of code and hardware as inbetween. It requirees quite a lot of different skill sets and knowledge of systems integration for this to work. Anyhow enough self-aggrandizing, I&#39;ll describe how I did it starting very low level at the and working my way up.</p>

<p>This summer I came into possession of an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> micro controller and <a href="http://www.rcuniverse.com/product_guide/servoprofile.cfm?servo_id=67">some servos</a>. As you can see from the pictures, I connected the servos up to the micro controller, making Y-cables for the power, ground, and signal pins of the servos. I also added a laser diode for good measure.</p>
<p>The servo signal pins were wired to the digital I/O ports on the arduino. I stuffed the Arduino in a metal box I had lying around and hot glued everything together. Predictably, the webcam itself didn&#39;t require much work. It was actually given to me for free! (previous owner couldn&#39;t find drivers for it). I just ripped the stand off of it and glued it to the servos. All in all, this was a cheap and simple that has performed very well for what it was designed to do.</p>

<h3 id="microcontroller-code">Microcontroller Code</h3>
<p>I wrote the following code to establish basic control of the Arduino over its USB serial adapter. The servos are controlled using a technique called pulse width modulation (PWM). The comments explain what is going on, but for further background reading you can check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">this</a>. It also uses EEPROM to store the position of the camera between power cycles and resets. For some background about what EEPROM is check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM">this</a>.</p>

<p>If you load the above code into the Arduino&#39;s IDE and flash it to your microcontroller, you end up with a nice, intuitive way of manually controlling your pan / tilt mechanism. You can try things out by opening the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE and moving around using WASD, or move to the extremes using TFGH. Pressing &#39;C&#39; centers the camera back and &#39;L&#39; <a href="http://spf.fotolog.com/photo/47/10/95/vanguardista2104/1211331863_f.jpg">fires the laser</a>. Arguably, you could stop here and technically still have a way of controlling the camera over the internet with the power of linux. All one would need to do is open up a terminal or ssh into the machine and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"> ~$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0</code></pre>
<p>This was not good enough for me though, as I wanted to control this through a web browser, which brings us to...</p>
<h3 id="the-web-server">The Web Server</h3>
<p><a href="../assets/img/posts/2010-02-08-193241.jpg"><img src="../assets/img/posts/2010-02-08-193241-150x150.jpg" alt="image" title="2010-02-08-193241"></a></p>
<p>The Arduino is cool and all, but since the ultimate goal of this project is to control it over the internet, having a web server is an obvious requirement. Unfortunately for me, my web server also happens to be my self-built desktop that I use for almost all my other engineering work and day to day activities. Because of this, I need access to few windows only applications (Solidworks, LabVIEW, Photoshop, Steam, etc..) which rules out any linux server platforms if I want 100% uptime. This is an unfortunate contstraint that caused me quite a lot of headaches down the line. In the future when I have another computer to spare and improve on this project, I will use the <a href="http://blog.taragana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/linux-logo.jpg">right tool</a> for the job. </p>
<p>After all that rambling, you&#39;re probably wondering how I have my web server configured. The only relevant details are that I am running stock <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WampServer</a> with PHP 5.3.0 with short tags enabled.</p>
<h3 id="nightmare-in-php-land">Nightmare in PHP land</h3>
<p>I thought this would be easy. Since PHP is a server side scripting language, it has libraries that allow it to read and write to and from serial ports. So one would think that something like the following would work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php"><span class="variable">$fp</span> =fopen(<span class="string">"COM3"</span>, <span class="string">"w"</span>);
fwrite(<span class="variable">$fp</span>, chr(<span class="string">'c'</span>)); <span class="comment">// write your character to the Arduino here</span>
sleep(<span class="number">1</span>);
fclose(<span class="variable">$fp</span>);</code></pre>
<p>However, for reasons I do not completely understand, this did not work for me under Windows 7, but it did with Linux (substituting COM3 for /dev/ttyUSB0). This problem persisted, as I also tried using the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/3679.html">PHP serial class</a>, but it too proved to be equally as ineffective. I finally circumvented the need for PHP to communicate with the COM port entirely by compiling several very basic exe&#39;s in <a href="http://processing.org/">processing</a> that sent individual character commands to the Arduino and then called them in PHP using the exec() function.</p>
<p>While extremely inefficient, this was the quickest, most reliable solution to my problem. Of course, this would all have been avoided in the first place had I been using Linux, as PHP has no problem writing to /dev/ttyUSB0 like it would a normal file in Linux.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-webpage">Building the Webpage</h3>
<p>By accessing the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/PHP/php_get.asp">PHP $_GET</a> array, I was able to map incoming GET requests to different URLS to control what commands were sent to the camera. The PHP included in the header of the page is shown here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php"><span class="comment">// check the GET action var to see if an action is to be performed</span>
<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">isset</span>(<span class="variable">$_GET</span>[<span class="string">'action'</span>]))
{
   <span class="comment">// action required! build our command...</span>
   <span class="variable">$basecmd</span> = <span class="string">"F:\\wamp\\www\\luke\\Projects\\personal_robot\\personal robot\\commands\\"</span>;
   <span class="variable">$cmd</span> = <span class="variable">$basecmd</span> . <span class="variable">$_GET</span>[<span class="string">'action'</span>] . <span class="string">"\\application.windows\\"</span> . <span class="variable">$_GET</span>[<span class="string">'action'</span>] . <span class="string">".exe"</span>;
   exec(<span class="variable">$cmd</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p>And the HTML for the rest of the page is simply a 3x3 table with some hyperlinks to the right URLs with things like ?action=up, ?action=down, ect. placed in the right spot.</p>

<p>To manage the webcam feed, I am using a program called <a href="http://www.lundie.ca/fwink/">Fwink</a> to take a picture every second and then using AJAX to automatically refresh the image once the page is loaded. However, there are many ways to manage a webcam feed and the details of how you do it is out of the scope of what I&#39;m talking about here.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-future-improvements">Conclusions and Future Improvements</h2>
<p>As expected, performance with this setup is less than impressive, but this was more a learning excersize than it was a perfect execution. I have no doubts in my mind that the low performance is due to the wonky way in which I have to execute system calls to run the Processing exes. For the future, as this is a rough prototype, a lot can be improved / simplified by moving to Linux.</p>
<p>Additionally, this is the vision component to my yet-to-be-completed personal robot, and its brains (a first generation ASUS eeepc netbook) are currently on loan to a friend of mine. Next time I see him I&#39;ll get the machine back and we&#39;ll start cooking with gas! (and by gas I mean Linux).</p>
