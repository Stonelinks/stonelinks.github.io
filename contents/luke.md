  <h1>Hi, I'm Lucas Doyle</h1>
</div>

I'm a programmer, roboticist, engineer and web developer. I live in Tokyo and work for <a target="blank_" href="http://mujin.co.jp">MUJIN</a>, an awesome little industrial robotics startup. I spend my time writing APIs and user interfaces that power MUJIN's robot programming platform.

I'm passionate about my work and love learning new things! These days I do a lot of high-level, user focused work with an emphasis on making complicated robotics technology accessible for users and developers alike.

In the past I've worked with microcontrollers, embedded [control systems](http://litec.rpi.edu/), CAD / CAM, automated manufacturing, autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, robotic telepresence, locomotion, simulation and machine vision. I've helped develop systems that fabricate experimental X-ray optics for space observatories at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I've also been programming for the web since day zero of my career. Check out a full list of projects I've worked on here.

Outside of robotics I also have a keen interest in aviation, astronomy, economics, making things with my hands and running. I'm a naturally curious individual and constantly have side projects going on. Oh and I love the outdoors!
