  <h1>Hi, I'm Lucas Doyle</h1>
</div>

I'm a programmer, roboticist, engineer and web developer. I live in San Francisco where I work for <a target="blank_" href="http://www.airware.com/">Airware</a>, an awesome company with humble goals of building a universal hardware and software platform for commercial drones.

I'm passionate about my work and love learning new things! These days I do a lot of high-level, user focused work with an emphasis on making complicated robotics technology accessible for users and developers alike.

This website is chock full of things that I'm interested in. In the past I've worked with <a class="microcontrollers">microcontrollers, embedded control systems</a>, <a class="battlebot">CAD / CAM</a>, <a class="harvard">automated manufacturing</a>, <a class="boat">autonomous</a> and <a class="ied">semi-autonomous</a> vehicles, <a class="anybots">robotic telepresence</a>, locomotion, <a class="wingbox">simulation</a> and <a class="camera">machine vision</a>. Previously I've lived and worked in Japan on the UI for an industrial robotics programming platform and helped develop systems that <a class="harvard">fabricate experimental X-ray optics for space observatories</a> at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I've also been <a class="web">programming for the web</a> since day zero of my career. Again, check out a full list of projects I've worked on [here](/projects.html).

Outside of robotics I also have a keen interest in <a class="plane">aviation</a>, astronomy, economics, making things with my hands, the outdoors and running. I'm a naturally curious individual and constantly have side projects going on. Enjoy my site!
