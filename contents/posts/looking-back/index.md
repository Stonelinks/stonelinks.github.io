TODO

This is old. Look at posts if you want to see current versions of my projects. This was like the first thing of great significance I did with Stonelinks on my own (read: I didn't know what I was doing). Similar to the Windows based webcam thing, I thought it was a big deal at the time. Looking back it is funny how trivial this would be to implement nowadays. Oh also, there are things in here that are just plain wrong and/or bad practice (left as an exercise to the reader to find).

**Edit:** This is old. It is also the first implementation of my remote-controlled camera... under windows. It is really really bad and nobody should use it. However, I thougt I was pretty cool when I made it, and maybe it will be useful to somebody here, so I'll leave it up. I put a much more improved version this software to use on [the border patrol robot](/misc/IED_tech_report_final.pdf). Check out page 48 of the report to see the final results and the page 118 for the code behind it.
