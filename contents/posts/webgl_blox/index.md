This is a quick and dirty attempt to a clone a really addicting android game called [Tap Blox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.entwicklerx.tapblox&hl=en). Play by eliminating groups of three or more adjacent blocks of the same color. Currently there is no timing / scoring system.

I did this as an educational exercise, mostly to play around with WebGL and improve my skills at Javascript (which I know very little about). Plus programming is fun in general. The WebGL library I used used is Mr. Doob's excellent [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). Hope you enjoy! Best results with Google Chrome.
