I've been in the Japanese industrial robotics / manufacturing scene for almost two years now. It is an interesting landscape that not a lot of us really think about. I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and thought I'd share some of my insights and perspectives. This is all based on what I've been able to put together over the past two years. A lot of this probably applies to much more than just manufacturing in Japan.

Think about what a factory is. To me, a factory is a great vehicle that takes a design and turns it into a physical product that gets sold. They're great big black boxes -- a design and raw materials go in one end, and products come out the other.

But they're not just black boxes. I also see them as bottlenecks -- very necessary and important bottlenecks, but bottlenecks nonetheless. 

Factories costs an astronomical amount of money. This statement probably comes as surprise to nobody, but why do they cost money? In my mind there are two major categories to think about when it comes to factories: capital cost and opportunity cost. Capital cost is obvious. These are the things needed to run the factory. The building, real estate, CNC machines, mills, injection machines, molds, drills, hydraulic presses, lathes, personnel, electricity, plastic, metal, nuts, bolts, oil, etc. all of these cost a ton of money.

The opportunity cost is a little less straightforward, but it comes from the time a company needs to wait while a factory gets set up and starts producing things. Once it gets going, then overall throughput (time per individual product) also factors into this. Basically opportunity cost arises any time a company looking to manufacture something is left waiting for a factory to produce something. This is time that the company could have been making money selling the product. In the worst case scenario, a competitor swoops in and steals what would have been the original company's business.

This opportunity cost is much harder to actually quantify (whereas capital is really easy to quantify), but it is imminently important. Any idiot knows the old adage "time is money". Nowhere is that more true than the world of manufacturing.

I think opportunity cost (and thus the time component) of factories dominate over their upfront cost. In most cases, not a whole lot can be done about the upfront cost of a factory. Capital is really expensive no matter what. CNC machines, mills, injection machines, molds, drills, hydraulic presses, lathes, personnel, electricity, plastic, metal, nuts, bolts, oil, etc. all of these cost a ton of money.

In my opinion the much more important (and frankly interesting) problem is what do you do with capital to maximize throughput and minimize time (and therefore opportunity cost). This the space of manufacturing that I think is ripe for innovation. The time it takes to do something in a factory is hugely variable depending on many, many things.

###Peeling Back the Veil

So what happens when we look at factories through the lens of black boxes and bottlenecks and attempt to tackle the time problem. First of all, how to peel back the veil is a different conversation entirely. Factories are exre

Once you start working with factories, to peel back the veil on the big black boxes known as factories (and they're very secretive about this... how you get factories to trust you is a whole different topic), they go from being one big bottleneck to a complicated web of intermediate steps and more bottlenecks. As an aside, part of me feels like the reason 3D printing is very attractive is it doesn't have the logistical / implementation complexity that factories suffer from. In essence 3D printers collapse all of these intermediate steps you'd normally have into a one or two big printing steps. It makes the barrier between design and physical product much lower, but of course comes with a million other constraints inherent to current generation 3D printing. Still, they shows off the weak spots of the way a "classical" factory works.

Anyhow as I was saying, we all know that people want the things factories produce as soon as possible. Whoever designed the product and sells it is losing an astronomical amount of money every second that factory isn't producing, and it gives competitors a chance to beat you to the market and steal all your potential revenue. There is ferocious demand, high pressure and stiff competition in the manufacturing world to be as quick as possible. Setup time, maintenance, failures and downtime of any kind cost millions. When coupled with our working definition of a factory as a series of intermediate steps and bottlenecks that take a design and raw materials and turn them into a product

First and foremost the manufacturing world embodies conservatism, but is in desperate need for modernization. 

Everybody in the industry knows this but has no clue how to actually execute anything. The "state of the art" for them is positively medieval by modern software engineering standards. Actually, software in general I'd say isn't very well understood or appreciated by the manufacturing world. I think its sort of looked at as this arcane computer wizardry that you need to make machines move. Words like "the cloud" are not really in these people's vocabulary for example.

So one would think that this is a space that is ripe with opportunity. People know they need to change and modernize and stand to benefit substantially from doing so. You'd be correct, however progress is less than easy. At least in Japan, everybody in the manufacturing industry is incredibly suspicious of new, unproven technology. Trust, security, and paranoia about competitors stifle innovation. For example, when we have meetings with some of these companies we're led into a separate building filled with white windowless meeting rooms. There is a table, projector, power outlets, and chairs. No internet (unless we tether off our phones, which is unreliable). All of our interaction with that company is then limited to what can occur in that room with those people in the time we have. Another good example: we were originally trying to push a cloud version of our product to companies. The benefits of cloud vs. self hosting are immense and obvious to anybody with half a clue, but they weren't buying it. So now we sell a "black box" server to companies with our software loaded on it. They plug it into the LAN and use it through the browser. A reasonable compromise, however a huge problem is they universally refuse to connect the thing to the internet let us push software updates to it. They also won't let us send them or have them download software patches over the internet, and then apply the update themselves. It all needs to be done in person or it flat out doesn't happen at all. Our product has no chance to improve and the customer never gets new features, bugfixes, improvements, etc., which is just terrible for everybody. All this mess isn't for lack of finesse or trying either. We have a Japanese guy who is a master negotiator (he was the top sales engineer in all of Japan for an extremely large drill bit company) try to make this happen, and they wouldn't budge. We gave up on what is right now an un-winnable argument against corporate stupidity. New paradigms in the way software works need to be around for a little while longer before they triumph over the decades of corporate (and arguably cultural) inertia. The point I'm trying to make is that while ripe with opportunity and a desire for newer, better things, progress is clouded by paranoia, skepticism in unproven technology, security concerns, hyper conservatism, risk-aversion, etc. It is a massively uphill battle. Companies like ours are literally dragging them into the future kicking and screaming.

Another thing I think you should know: the manufacturing landscape in Japan (the rest of Asia follows this template too). Lets use a company like Canon for example. Lets say a team in Canon's product development department comes up with this new awesome camera that they want to mass produce and sell to consumers. They need a factory to build that camera. Now Canon is a company with some manufacturing experience, but they're really good at designing in selling cameras, not at making factories. So they get help from companies called "system integrators" who do the real gruntwork of building the factory so Canon can make its new camera. There are TONS of system integrators in Japan (actually they're all over the place in Asia). Some are huge, some are tiny, some have different specializations that they're really good at like robotics, or milling, or glass extrusion, or painting, or whatever. These system integrators basically coming up with applications of tools and equipment to put in Canon's new factory so it can make camera. However, these tools and equipment that the system integrators use have to come from somewhere. That is where the companies that make the tools (the robots, milling machines, PLCs, CNC lathes, etc.) come in. That is the space MUJIN mostly operates right now. So to recap: Canon works with system integrators to design and build a factory, and the system integrators in turn work with tool and equipment makers to actually make the factory a reality. My knowledge sort of drops off here, but after the factory is built and they have the supply line in order, they start cranking out cameras and market them to consumers.
