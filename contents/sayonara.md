Hey friends and strangers! I'm moving out of my apartment this week and need to get rid of some stuff. I'm giving all of these items away to anyone who claims them first and shows up to pick it up at my apartment on **10/22 (Wednesday) and 10/23 (Thursday)**. To claim an item (or just ask a question) just click the button and email me. If you want it, we'll coordinate when you'll pick it up. Feel free to go after multiple things, but please send seperate emails for each item.

Here is where I live when you come pick things up: [http://goo.gl/7P81wg](http://goo.gl/7P81wg).

Also sorry about all the messy pictures. My life is busy and I haven't had time to clean, but everything works and is in good, gently used condition.
