Back in November I had the chance to take a survey of all the different binpicking systems at the International Robotics Exhibition (IREX) in Tokyo, Japan. [IREX](http://www.nikkan.co.jp/eve/irex/english/) is massive, the world's largest robotics expo. It happens every two years and is chock full of impressive demos. This year my favorite had to be the [full scale welding line](http://youtu.be/QR4lG98Ehng) that Mitsubishi made. I was there with MUJIN and even had my picture on a few advertisements:

As a small robot company just starting out at trying to make one of these binpicking systems, I felt it was important to make a survey of these things. Maybe someone other than us will find this exhaustive analysis useful. I've included videos of each (got some really nasty looks trying to record them)!
