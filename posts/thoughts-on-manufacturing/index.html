            <hr><p>I’ve been in the Japanese industrial robotics scene for almost two years now. Part of me wishes I was writing some sort of exposé on the dark underbelly of the manufacturing world. A world full of drama, scandal and secrets. If this underbelly exists I havn’t found it yet – but what the manufacturing world lacks in sexiness it makes up for in&nbsp;importance.</p>

<p>Literally every possession you own is manufactured in some capacity. The human practice of “making stuff” is ancient and an incredibly broad discipline. Adobe bricks for Pueblos, chain-mail for medieval knights, longboats for Vikings and amphora so the Romans and Greeks could transport liquids are a small cross section of manufactured goods seen throughout history. Today when we think of manufacturing, (if we think of anything) it is of large buildings in a far away place known as&nbsp;factories.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Factories are the beating heart at the center of industrialization in the 20<span class="ord">th</span> century. Thanks to globalization and a couple of world wars, factories and their supply chains have propelled us into a post-industrial proliferation of endless “stuff”. Cars, laptops, phones, tablets, books, furniture, clothes. Anything you can think of, it is probably mass produced somewhere in some capacity. It ends up on a shelf or on Amazon for us to purchase and&nbsp;enjoy.</p>
<p>Whenever we get a shiny new iPhone or Nexus, we neither know nor care about the factory it came from. For the crucial role they play in our daily lives, the humble factory stays out of sight and out of mind. Given the tremendous change agents they are and what changes I see for them in the future, I thought it prudent to share some of my insights and perspectives on them. This of course all my own&nbsp;opinion.</p>

<p>Think about what a factory is. To me, a factory is a great vehicle that takes a design and turns it into a physical product. In a sense they’re great big black boxes – raw materials go in one end, and products come out the other. But they are something else: bottenecks. Very necessary and important bottlenecks, but bottlenecks&nbsp;nonetheless.</p>

<p>The way I think about factories is rooted heavily in cost. Factories cost an astronomical amount of time and money. Purchasing and coordinating that many people, machines and material effectively is akin to writing a symphony, being a quarterback in the <span class="caps">NFL</span> or playing chess against a grand master. It requires immense logistical finesse and of course a tons of capital and money to keep going. This probably comes as surprise to nobody, but let us break down what really goes into the cost of a&nbsp;factory.</p>
<p>In my mind there are two major categories to think about when it comes to factory cost: capital cost and opportunity cost. Capital cost is fairly obvious. These are the things needed to run the factory: real estate, electricity, engineers, line workers, technicians, supervisors, janitors, <span class="caps">CNC</span> machines, mills, injection machines, molds, drills, hydraulic presses, lathes, plastic, carbon fiber, aluminum, nuts, bolts, oil, etc. The list is probably endless. Basically any direct expense is a capital&nbsp;cost.</p>

<p>Invariably, the capital put towards a factory is always high. There is no “silver bullet” that is going to magically make them extremely cheap in the long term. Sure there are stopgap ways to lower the upfront capital cost by building your factory in a country with cheap labor and lax environmental laws. We’ve seen tons of this in Asia in the last half century. In my opinion, these cost cutting decisions are neither sustainable or very interesting. Our world is getting smaller and smaller every day. Within the next century I think we’ll run out of labor markets, environmental slack and legal loopholes to exploit. Okay I’ll concede that legal loopholes probably aren’t going away anytime soon. Natural resources and labor are finite and will inevitably become scarce and expensive at some point. But it isn’t hard to look at correlation between increased wealth / standard of living and manufacturing quality in countries like Japan and China over the last half century and extrapolate to other countries. To use an aphorism that I find apropos “a rising tide lifts all&nbsp;boats”.</p>
<!--

Japan is practically the poster child for this sort of thing. Post-WWII, if something in the USA was "made in japan" it was seen as a mark of low quality and disdain on many products. These days it couldn't be any different -- Japan makes some of the world's best electronics and automobiles and is even a huge supplier to high profile American companies like Boeing. Again this type of dramatic turn-around is only in the last half century, and the Japanese people have enjoyed increased wealth and incredibly high living standards as their collective manufacturing prowess has grown into what it is today. This isn't without its downsides though -- the labor force, which is still a very necessary part of the economy, has gotten really small and expensive during this time.

Anyways, similar things will keep happening in other countries where labor is cheap. China is in the middle of this right now. But if things continue the way they have been, as labor gets more expensive in China, the world's capitalists will turn to places like Bangladesh or Vietnam for the cheapest labor. They'll pay bottom dollar for people to work ungodly hours in unsafe environments. While some will see this as exploitive, we can't ignore the fact that with very few exceptions this model works -- we've been doing it since time immemorial. Look what Japan did in a half century. What could nations like Bangladesh or Vietnam look like in century?

I'm way off topic here... back to my original point: factory capital cost is high and there is not a whole lot we can do about it. Factories by their very nature are expensive and upfront capital cost cutting measures are going to become less and less relevant over time.

-->
<p>What is far more interesting to me than capital cost is opportunity cost. Unlike capital which is straightforward measure, opportunity cost is a little less harder to quantify. Instead of being a direct cost, it finds its roots in <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>Lets say a company approaches a factory to get its new product produced. During the time the company needs to wait for the factory to get set up and start production, it incurs an opportunity cost. It it losing revenue that could have made had it been able to sell the product as soon as the design was finalized. Once the factory gets going, this opportunity cost doesn’t completely go away. Instead the overall throughput (time per individual product) starts to factor into the opportunity&nbsp;cost.</p>
<p>Therein lies why I see factories as bottlenecks; waiting for factories cost an enormous amount of money when you factor in the opportunity cost. Best case scenario consumers are patient and wait for the product. But in the worst case, a competitor swoops in and steals what would have been the original company’s business. There are entire disciplines dedicated to this time problem with factories. Supply chain management, just in time manufacturing, industrial engineering, etc. In fact I’m sure that everything I’m writing here is probably in a textbook for these&nbsp;disciplines.</p>
<p>Regardless, as I said opportunity cost is much harder to quantify than capital cost. but by looking at factories as black boxes and analyzing the bottlenecks on the time dimension, we can deconstruct specific problems and make smart decisions on how to optimize them. I think this is the approach we should take. Some may balk at the extreme capital costs associated with even a minor time saving measures. Remember that cost and time are inexorably tied to one another. If targeting the right bottleneck, even a tiny but expensive improvement in the time dimension can pay for itself big time in the cost dimension given the increased volume. Everybody knows the old saying “time is money”. Nowhere is that more true than the world of&nbsp;manufacturing.</p>
<h3 id="the-plight-of-conservatism">The Plight of&nbsp;Conservatism</h3>
<p>So all this is great, we know time is the issue that needs attention. What happens when we actually try to make factories faster? Once we start peering under the lid of the black boxes of factories (and how to peer under that lid is a different conversation entirely, factories are notoriously secretive and earning their trust is hard work), they go from being one big bottleneck / black box to a complicated web of intermediate steps and black boxes. Basically a big directed graph of smaller black boxes with their own&nbsp;bottlenecks.</p>

<p>This is going to seem like switching topics, but I want to consider 3D printing for a second. Besides being a buzzword, part of me feels like there is a lot of hype around 3D printing due to the lack of logistical / implementation complexity that “classic” factories suffer from. A 3D printer is one machine that potentially replaces a workshop full of much more expensive machines. They can make nearly endless objects and shapes with one simple extrusion tool. In essence they combine the numerous intermediate steps required in a “classic” factory and replace them with one big printing step. It makes the barrier between design and physical product much lower, something immediately recognizable by many people. Of course current generation 3D printing comes with a million downsides which are out of this document’s scope. But still, they show off many of the weak spots of a “classic” factory in a very effective&nbsp;manner.</p>
<p>We all know that people want the things factories produce as soon as possible. Whoever designed and sells the product is losing an astronomical amount of money every second that factory isn’t producing. There is ferocious demand, high pressure and stiff competition that all converge upon factories. Set up time, maintenance, failures and downtime of any kind cost millions. Add to the mix that while they are ideally static, factories are always undergoing some kind of change. A new line is being built, an old line is being deprecated, a machine reached the end of it’s service lifetime, a supplier changed or went out of business,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>The result of all this is what I call the “plight of conservatism”. Given that a factory is represented by a series of black boxes, any time a change needs to occur usually only the most minimal set of black boxes that absolutely have to change will ever change to meet new criteria and deadlines. In other words, hyper conservatism. The people responsible for making decisions don’t have the time to educate themselves enough to take advantage of new time saving technology. The kind of thing to enable them to think strategically. Even if they did know about all the latest and greatest technology to help them, they are incredibly risk averse. And can you blame them? <span class="caps">As I</span> said the stakes are incredibly high and even minor risks are avoided like the plague unless they are absolutely necessary. So they keep their heads in the sand and stick with what works regardless of the long term&nbsp;consequences.</p>

<p>Those consequences of largely ignoring modernization are about to come to fruition with the maturity of factory automation technology. The plight of conservatism has made innovation and advancement in manufacturing agonizingly slow and frustrating for almost everyone in the sector. The higher-ups and decision makers finally see that higher degrees of factory automation are the way forward. So they’re trying to learn and use them or else get left in the dust. <span class="caps">As I</span> said this industry is incredibly competitive. Unfortunately most factories are in the proverbial stone age thanks to the enduring conservatism and never ending pressure to keep producing. So they are ill-equipped and can’t exactly stop what they are doing to learn a bunch of stuff about factory automation and change the millions of little black boxes that need to be&nbsp;changed.</p>
<h3 id="where-this-is-going">Where this is&nbsp;Going</h3>
<p>The state of the manufacturing world is pretty much this: everybody knows they need to modernize on some level but has no clue how to actually do it in a comprehensive way. They know bits and pieces of the puzzle but the gestalt is missing. Software in particular, which is my opinion is the key to the puzzle, is generally not well understood. Software can enable speedups on all those black boxes, and that maybe some of those black boxes can be reused and take the place of many other slower black&nbsp;boxes.</p>
<p>I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention robotics. Great robot hardware is already out there, but more sophisticated software to control them has to be written. They are capable of accomplishing so much if only their potential gets&nbsp;realized.</p>

<p>Programming is a relatively new and (as most of us know) fantastically powerful tool in the factory automator’s arsenal. Problem is that it is a moving target. Most factory types can’t be bothered to stop their incredibly time sensitive jobs and learn about something that is constantly changing. As such, most look at programming as arcane computer wizardry that you need to make machines move and do&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>I want to wrap things up by talking about the way forward. <span class="caps">As I</span> said, factories rarely (if ever) stop to learn the latest and greatest technology and apply it themselves. Instead, they pay other companies to do this for them. These are called system integrators and they’re incredibly important since they provide a vector for creating and manipulating the black boxes in factories. There are TONS of system integrators in Japan (actually they’re all over the place). Some are huge, some are tiny, some have different specializations that they’re really good at like robotics, milling, glass extrusion, painting, etc. They come up with applications of tools and equipment to put in a factory so it can make part of the&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>The tools and equipment that the system integrators use generally come from somewhere else. That is where the companies that make the tools (robot companies, <span class="caps">CNC</span> and milling machine makers, PLCs makers, etc.) come in. If a tool is complicated enough maybe the company that makes it has its own network of suppliers and means of production! So this can be a recursive&nbsp;pattern.</p>
<p>It is this interface between the tool makers and system integrators that tremendous opportunity exists for new innovation. If you come up with some awesome tool, a system integrator will give proper feedback and eventually get it deployed to a real factory. It is this kind of ground up approach that may seem small now but I feel will pay big dividends down the&nbsp;line.</p>

###Blockages

At least in Japan, everybody in the manufacturing industry is incredibly suspicious of new, unproven technology. Trust, security, and paranoia about competitors stifle innovation. For example, I've had meetings with some of these companies where we've been led into entirely separate buildings filled with white windowless meeting rooms. There is a table, projector, power outlets, and chairs. No internet (unless we tether off our phones, which doesn't always work). All of our interaction with that company is limited to what can occur in that room with those people in the time we have, which is obviously incredibly limiting. Another good example: we were originally trying to push a cloud version of our product to companies. The benefits of cloud vs. self hosting are immense and obvious to anyone with half a clue how the internet works, but they weren't buying it. So now we sell a "black box" version to companies. This is a server with our software loaded on it. They plug it in and use it through a browser over the LAN. A huge problem is that they universally refuse to connect it to the internet for it to receive updates (conservatism is a pernicious beast). They also won't download updates manually or let us send them, and then apply the update themselves (much in the same way you'd update the firmware on your wireless router for example). Things need to be done in person or it flat out doesn't happen at all. Our product seldom has any chance to improve and the customer rarely gets new features, bugfixes or improvements. It is pretty terrible for everybody. All this mess isn't for lack of trying or negotiating finesse either. We gave up on what is right now an un-winnable argument against corporate stupidity. New paradigms in the way software works need to be around longer (or companies need to be desperate) before they triumph over the decades of inertia going the other way.

The point I'm trying to make is that while ripe with opportunity and a desire for better things, progress is hindered by paranoia, skepticism in unproven technology, security concerns, hyper conservatism, risk-aversion, etc. It is a massively uphill battle. Companies like the one I work for are dragging them into the future kicking and screaming.

Another thing I think you should know: the manufacturing landscape in Japan (the rest of Asia follows this template too). Lets use a company like Canon for example. Lets say a team in Canon's product development department comes up with this new awesome camera that they want to mass produce and sell to consumers. They need a factory to build that camera. Now Canon is a company with some manufacturing experience, but they're really good at designing in selling cameras, not at making factories. So they get help from companies called "system integrators" who do the real gruntwork of building the factory so Canon can make its new camera. There are TONS of system integrators in Japan (actually they're all over the place in Asia). Some are huge, some are tiny, some have different specializations that they're really good at like robotics, or milling, or glass extrusion, or painting, or whatever. These system integrators basically coming up with applications of tools and equipment to put in Canon's new factory so it can make camera. However, these tools and equipment that the system integrators use have to come from somewhere. That is where the companies that make the tools (the robots, milling machines, PLCs, CNC lathes, etc.) come in. That is the space MUJIN mostly operates right now. So to recap: Canon works with system integrators to design and build a factory, and the system integrators in turn work with tool and equipment makers to actually make the factory a reality. My knowledge sort of drops off here, but after the factory is built and they have the supply line in order, they start cranking out cameras and market them to consumers.
