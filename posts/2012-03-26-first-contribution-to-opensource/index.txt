<p>Up until now, all my contributions to open source have been programs I have written, and as a general practice I like to make all my work open source if I can. However, its a nice feeling to have some code I wrote incorporated into someone else's project for a change.</p>
<p>The program in question here is called <a href="https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD">OpenTLD</a>. Its a program for tracking objects (not just faces) in unconstrained video streams with NO training data beforehand (TLD stands for <strong>T</strong>racking, <strong>L</strong>earning and <strong>D</strong>etection). Instead of using precomputed classifiers (like I previously have done with OpenCV), OpenTLD builds a model of what it is supposed to be detecting on the fly. To demonstrate, above is a slightly creepy demo of OpenTLD tracking my face.</p>
<p>The version of OpenTLD here is actually the C++ implementation of OpenTLD. OpenTLD began life as a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD">Matlab programs</a> written as part of Zdenek Kalal's PHD thesis. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GhNXHCQGsM">Here</a> is a more advanced video by him talking / showing off OpenTLD (he calls it Predator).</p>
<p>But so yeah! <a href="https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD/pull/11">I actually contributed to this</a>! Even though the code I wrote is trivial (it had to do with the bounding box when you first start the program), it still makes me really excited. I plan on taking a closer look at the codebase sometime later and trying to learn how it works. Up until now all my contributions to open source have been programs I have written. It feels really cool to have a change I made rolled into this super advanced computer vision program!</p>2:["$","div",null,{"className":"page_main__nw1Wk","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_header__oRW75","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"src":"/icon.png","alt":"Logo","width":100,"height":100,"priority":true}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_title-nav-container__yDV6g","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"page_hero-title__ISM_Q","children":"Stonelinks"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"page_nav-list__BIYWj","children":[["$","li",null,{"children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/","children":"Home"}]}],["$","li",null,{"children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/posts","children":"Posts"}]}],["$","li",null,{"children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/projects","children":"Projects"}]}],["$","li",null,{"children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/luke","children":"About"}]}]]}]]}]]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"post_post__6EpyE","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"post_title__Rgtqi","children":"First Contribution to Open Source Software"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"common_date__JU5vN","children":"March 26, 2012"}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"TagList_tagList__ukBDA","children":[["$","$L7","0",{"className":"TagList_tag__225v4","href":"/tags/computer%20vision","children":"computer vision"}],["$","$L7","1",{"className":"TagList_tag__225v4","href":"/tags/C%2B%2B","children":"C++"}]]}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"post_content__KF6Q6","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$9"}}]]}],["$","footer",null,{"children":["© Lucas Doyle ",2025]}]]}]
