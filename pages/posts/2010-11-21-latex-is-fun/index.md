I'm using the documentation I'm writing for work at the Harvard-Smithsonain Center for Astrophysics as an excuse to learn LaTeX. For those in my generation who have grown up with MS Office or openoffice.org, LaTeX is a typesetting language that can trace its roots back to the legendary [Donald Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) who wrote TeX back in the '70s.

Long story short, it is awesome and really straightforward if you're a programmer. Honestly the thing that upsets me the most about LaTeX is that I didn't know it existed back when Matt and I were writing / editing that [137 page paper](/misc/IED_tech_report_final.pdf) for the IED border patrol robot!
