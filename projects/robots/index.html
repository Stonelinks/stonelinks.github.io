Other robots such as <span class="caps">FIRST</span> or Battlebots can be seen elsewhere on the site (like the <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a>&nbsp;page).</p>

            <p>Despite its shortcomings, this remains as one of the best builds I have been a part of. This robot went from idea, to concept, to design and finally to implementation in six short weeks in response to an open ended project for a &#8220;<span class="caps">GPS</span> robotic platform&#8221; sponsored by Lockheed Martin. Our chosen application was the remote detection of illegal immigrants. The customer benefits were that with enough of these robots, one border patrol agent has mobile eyes in many places, is taken out of harms way, and can use aggregated GPS data to track trends, such as where are most the most immigrants coming from.

This robot went from idea, to concept, to design and finally to implementation in six short weeks in response to an open ended project for a &#8220;GPS robotic platform&#8221; sponsored by Lockheed Martin. Our chosen application was the remote detection of illegal immigrants. The customer benefits were that with enough of these robots, one border patrol agent has mobile eyes in many places, is taken out of harms way, and can use aggregated GPS data to track trends, such as where are most the most immigrants coming from. On one hand, this project was a failure as we totally failed to produce a mechanically sound robot that could drive around and do what we wanted. On the other hand, I got to write some amazing software to control this thing from the internet, write NMEA parsers for the GPS data, discovered MJPG streaming, work with the Google maps API, etc. More importantly, I also learned a ton about how a team can break down, how to think about design problems in terms of what a customer wants, how to conduct research and benchmarking against similar products, how to lead a group, how to present things to a non-technical customer (that one was fun! I couldn&#8217;t talk about programming at all in the final presentation) and make efficient technical decisions with a deadline in mind. Probably the most frustrating thing about this robot was that despite having five of our seven team members on the mechanical side of things, the only thing that didn&#8217;t work were the mechanics. It was the kind of team dynamic where two team members (Matt Williamson and I&#8230; Matt deserves a medal for his work on the electrical system) made up for everyone else&#8217;s lack of experience or slacking off in the end. Matt and I basically ended up writing most of the 137 page [technical report](/misc/IED_tech_report_final.pdf). Overall I had a blast with it, and it remains a robot I am very proud of. You can see a gallery of pictures of this robot&nbsp;[here](todo.html).

            <p>The Litec blimp was the final project for an embedded control class I took at the end of my Sophomore year. While the blimp hardware was provided, the majority of the challenge was becoming familiar enough with the Intel 8051 micro controller architecture to implement things like <span class="caps">PID</span> control, I2C, SPI, PWM, interrupts, analog to digital conversion, etc. The ultimate goal of the blimp was to be able to autonomously hold a specified altitude and heading. More than anything, working with the 8051 made me appreciate how much is being automatically taken care of when working with something like an&nbsp;Arduino.</p>

It never made it into the real world but still remains a viable design as far as I am concerned. A lot written about it&nbsp;[here](/projects/battlebot.html).</p>

            <p>This robot at first wasn&#8217;t even really a robot, just some servos, a pan tilt module and an Arduino. However, just like Stonelinks, it has had many incarnations over the years and exists primary as an educational tool for me to learn more and mess around with. Over the years it has been controlled from windows, linux, Labview, locally, from the internet, to no <span class="caps">PC</span> at all. It used to be attached to a netbook and some wheels, and I used to drive it around the dorm and talk to people using text to speech. In its current incarnation, it has functioned mostly as a stationary observer. When I get some time, I have plans to start using it to teach myself more about computer vision. I also don&#8217;t really have a good picture for it as it is always changing, so here is a video of it detecting&nbsp;faces.</p>

            <p>One of the best summers of my life was spent in Concord <span class="caps">NH</span> at the St. Paul&#8217;s Advanced Studies Program taking a grad level AI class with Terry Wardrop and other talented and like minded students from around NH. We spent the summer learning things like game theory, programming in LISP, finite state automata, building simple robots, etc. The culmination however occurred when the whole class pulled together and tried to design an autonomous boat around a FIRST controller, some 8020, and old sailboat hull and trolling motor. I was in charge of the steering system, which failed terrifically as I was not allowed to modify the trolling motor in any way so I tried to do it with rope (didn&#8217;t work). As you can see from the picture (I did a lot of running that summer and was basically a twig) the class also elected me to be the &#8220;test pilot&#8221;. Nothing like being in an old sail boat hull filled with electronics (those cold cathode lights were high voltage too!) surrounded by&nbsp;water.</p>

            <p>I may or may not owe approximately all of my engineering and mechanical intuition to Legos. I used to (and most likely still do &#8211; I used this all through high school) love playing with these things. The pinnacle of any Lego set I have ever gotten or probably will ever get has to be the Robotics Invention System. Thank god for my generous and understanding parents for not laughing me out of the room when 4<span class="ord">th</span> grader me wanted this $200 kit (I&#8217;m not spoiled, they made me work for it, don&#8217;t worry). Just writing about it makes me want to jump out of this chair, run down to the basement and pull it out and start building. I cannot tell you the hours I spent building and programming (though mostly building) with this thing. More than any other robot on this page, the <span class="caps">RCX</span> played a pivotal role in who I am now as a roboticist (if I can even call myself that), as it is endlessly configurable by curious youngsters such as&nbsp;myself.</p>
