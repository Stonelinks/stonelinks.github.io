            <hr><p>I had the great fortune of participating and captaining <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/"><span class="caps">FIRST</span> robotics</a> team 1831 throughout my time at Gilford High School. Here are the robots we built in chronological&nbsp;order.</p>

            <div class="external-links"><p>This was the first year Gilford High School had a First Robotics team. Pictured above is our rookie team&#39;s entry into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_High">Aim High</a> competition. It is a relatively unsophisticated beast of a robot that could pretty much get hit by a train and still work. Fundamentally, its function was to pick up, store and shoot foam balls into a goal. Sadly this was so long ago (5 years as of writing this) I don&#39;t specifically remember much of the details about&nbsp;it.</p></div>

            <div class="external-links"><p>As is evident from that video, this robot represented our team&#39;s first foray into the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mechanum wheels</a>. These wheels are a variation on a theme of omni wheels that let the robot move in any direction unconstrained. For the next two years, I would help design mechanum drive trains for our team (<span class="caps">CAD</span> mostly). While really cool, our teams obsession over these wheels would cause us to lose sight of the arm attachment that would need to perform the robot&#39;s function of removing tubes from the rack for 2007&#39;s <a href="http://goo.gl/qhaI1X">Rack &#39;n Roll</a>&nbsp;competition.</p></div>

            <div class="external-links"><p>This was basically the 2007 design, part two. The competition was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Overdrive">Overdrive</a>, which was essentially a race with large balls in the track that accumulate points as you corral them around. You could also just drive around for points. As captain, I wanted to steer the team in the direction of &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot; and essentially wanted to design a dragster type robot. However, part of working as a team is accepting other people&#39;s ideas even when you don&#39;t necessarily agree with&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>The team went with mechanum wheels, and again we lost sight of what we were originally trying to do (heard the ball) and probably could have made a better robot. Still, I tried to make the best of it and designed a completely modular chassis for the wheels. I made one standard &quot;box&quot; design that self-contained a speed controller, the wheel, bearings, pillow blocks, etc. This box could be iterated four times and bolted together to make a robot. This saved design time, simplified troubleshooting and made it a breeze to replace&nbsp;parts.</p>

<p>Another interesting side effect of the box wheel module design &#8211; I learned how to properly weld aluminum (there were a <span class="caps">TON</span> of joints), which is quite tricky (but&nbsp;fun!).</p>

<p>All in all our team had really perfected the mechanum drive train, so it was not a total loss. We drove around that track like a boss. Also, this particular year I did not do any nordic skiing for the school team (which I usually did), so I contributed much of the programming and electrical system on top of the <span class="caps">CAD</span> and machining for the drive&nbsp;train.</p></div>

            <div class="external-links"><p>Something awesome about <span class="caps">FIRST</span> is the role of mentors. They arn&#39;t there to design or build things for you, but to be a resource that can enable, advise and empower students to accomplish and learn amazing things. At some point in my life, I&#39;d really like to be a FIRST mentor so that I can get a taste of what this is like and inspire the next generation of young roboticists just like the mentors at Gilford inspired&nbsp;me.</p></div>
