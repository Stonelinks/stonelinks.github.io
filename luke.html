  <h1>Hi, I’m Lucas&nbsp;Doyle</h1>
</div>

<p>I’m a programmer, roboticist, engineer and web developer. I live in Tokyo and work for <a target="blank_" href="http://mujin.co.jp"><span class="caps">MUJIN</span></a>, an awesome little industrial robotics startup. I spend my time making the APIs and user interfaces that power <span class="caps">MUJIN</span>’s robot programming&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about my work and love learning new things! These days I do a lot of high-level, user focused work with a focus on making complicated robotics technology accessable for users and developers&nbsp;alike.</p>
<p>To accomplish this I draw on a strong and multifaceted technical background. In the past I’ve worked with microcontrollers, embedded <a href="http://litec.rpi.edu/">control systems</a>, <span class="caps">CAD</span> / CAM, automated manufacturing, autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, robotic telepresence, locomotion, simulation and machine vision. I’ve helped develop systems that fabricate experimental X-ray optics for space observatories at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I’ve also been programming for the web since day zero of my&nbsp;career.</p>
<p>Outside of robotics I also have a keen interest in avaiation, astronomy, economics, making things with my hands and running. I’m a naturally curious individual and constantly have side projects going on. Oh and I love the&nbsp;outdoors!</p>
<div class="hide">

###Background

For the past three years, I’ve worked for the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</a> developing systems to fabricate experimental X-ray optics for space observatories (read about it <a href="/projects/harvard.html">here</a>). Additionally, last summer (2011) I had the phenomenal opportunity to work at a Silicon Valley robotics startup called Anybots on their telepresence robots. While I was there I authored a time saving robot bug and asset tracking system called <a href="/projects/anybots.html">Anystats</a>. I was also the leader and head programmer for a collaborative robot planning and simulation framework developed for Boeing during my senior design project at <span class="caps">RPI</span>. The robot was designed to improve aircraft design by eliminating the ergonomic constraints for human access to the inside of an aircraft wing (read more about it <a href="/projects/wingbox.html">here</a>). I’ve been involved in many more projects, check them out on my <a href="/projects/index.html">projects page</a>.

<br>

###Robotics

My technical interests are generally concentrated within the fields of robotics, simulation and automation. I’ve worked with microcontrollers, embedded <a href="http://litec.rpi.edu/">control systems</a>, <span class="caps">CAD</span> / CAM design, automated manufacturing, autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, robotic telepresence, locomotion, simulation and machine vision. I find robotics as a whole to be the most interesting application of technology in the world, and believe that they will fundamentally change how we live our lives in the future.

<br>

###Programming

In addition to robotics, I’ve always had a very strong connection to computers and programming. I absolutely love to code! Python is currently my language of choice, but each language has its benefits and drawbacks. I consider each language I know as a tool suited for a particular role. I’m also well versed in the version control and industry standard development patterns / practices (see you at the scrum!). I am a seasoned <a href="http://www.debian.org/"><span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux</a> user and lover of <span class="caps">FOSS</span>. Installing GNU/Linux on all my computers was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made and really kickstarted my development as a programmer. I used to actually host this website from my dorm room on a server that I built myself back in high school, but now the it is running <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">in the cloud</a> on a <a href="/projects/stonelinks.html">framework</a> I wrote myself.

<br>

###Education

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, B.S., Computer and Systems Engineering

<br>

###Other Interests

Outside of robotics and programming, I enjoy sailing, running, cycling, a bit of video games (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) and of course all the <a href="/img/me-camera.jpg">tom-foolery</a> that comes about when living with friends and fellow engineers. I’ve always had a fascination for aviation, aeronautics, economics and (predictably) science fiction. I’m also a published poet. I take pride in the high standards I hold myself, and don’t like to consider myself an expert on any single subject as there is always more to learn. I also have an inquisitive mind that doesn’t easily take things at face value, and I’m constantly inventing, experimenting and learning. I consider myself very fortunate to be where I am, and sincerely thank everyone who has helped me get here.
